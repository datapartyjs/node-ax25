## I have no plans on returning to work on this project. If I ever do, it'll be a total rewrite.

The packet parsing/encoding stuff works, so I guess you could use this as the basis for something else, especially UI stuff like APRS.

The Session object is pretty broken, so I wouldn't try to do any connected-mode stuff without basically redoing that.
